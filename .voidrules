This is a fork of the VSCode repo called Void.

Most code we care about lives in src/vs/workbench/contrib/void.

You may often need to explore the full repo to find relevant parts of code.
Look for services and built-in functions that you might need to use to solve the problem.

In typescript, do NOT cast to types if not neccessary. NEVER lazily cast to 'any'. Find the correct type to apply and use it.

Do not add or remove semicolons to any of my files. Just go with convention and make the least number of changes.

Never modify files outside src/vs/workbench/contrib/void without consulting with the user first.

All types that map from a value A to B should be called bOfA. For example, if you create a hashmap that goes from toolId to toolName, it should be called toolNameOfToolId, etc.

Do not run anything to validate your changes; tell the user what to do instead.
