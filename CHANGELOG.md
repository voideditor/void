## Jan. 12, 2025 - Entering beta

- Added quick edits! Void handles FIM-prompting, output parsing, and history management for inline UI.

- Migrated away from VS Code extension API - Void now lives and interacts entirely within the VS Code codebase.

- New settings page with model configuration, one-click switch, and user settings.

- Added auto-detection (via polling) of local models by default.

- LLM requests originate from `node/`, which fixes common CORS and CSP issues when running some models locally.

- Misc improvements like UI and history for Accept | Reject in the sidebar and editor, streaming interruptions, and past chat history.

- Automatic file selection on tab switches.

- Lots of new UI, misc bug fixes, and performance improvements.

- Switched from the MIT License to the Apache 2.0 License. Apache's attribution clause provides a small amount of protection to our source initiative.

A huge shoutout to our many contributors. If you'd like to help build Void,

## Sept/Oct. 2024 - Early launch
