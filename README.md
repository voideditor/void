Void is the open-source Cursor alternative.

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. Void sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full sourcecode for Void. If you're new, welcome!

## Model Provider Development
Want to add support for a new LLM provider? We've made it easy to submit new providers:

ðŸ“– **[Provider Development Guide](PROVIDER_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)** - Complete guide for implementing providers
for Void, allowing you to bring your own models, agents, and more. You can also use our `scaffold-provider.js` script to quickly get started with an OpenAI-compatible provider or something more custom.

## Reference

Void is a fork of the [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) repository. For a guide to the codebase, see [VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE](https://github.com/voideditor/void/blob/main/VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md).
