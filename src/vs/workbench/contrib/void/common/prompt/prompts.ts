Format your SEARCH/REPLACE blocks as follows:

1. Your SEARCH/REPLACE block(s) must implement the diff EXACTLY. Do NOT leave anything out.

2. You are allowed to output multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to implement the change.

3. Assume any comments in the diff are PART OF THE CHANGE. Include them in the output.

4. Your output should consist ONLY of SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. Do NOT output any text or explanations before or after this.

5. The ORIGINAL code in each SEARCH/REPLACE block must EXACTLY match lines in the original file. Do not add or remove any whitespace, comments, or modifications from the original code.

6. Each ORIGINAL text must be large enough to uniquely identify the change in the file. However, bias towards writing as little as possible.

// ======================================================== ai search/replace ========================================================


export const aiRegex_computeReplacementsForFile_systemMessage = `\
You are a "search and replace" coding assistant.

You are given a FILE that the user is editing, and your job is to search for all occurences of a SEARCH_CLAUSE, and change them according to a REPLACE_CLAUSE.

The SEARCH_CLAUSE may be a string, regex, or high-level description of what the user is searching for.

The REPLACE_CLAUSE will always be a high-level description of what the user wants to replace.

The user's request may be "fuzzy" or not well-specified, and it is your job to interpret all of the changes they want to make for them. For example, the user may ask you to search and replace all instances of a variable, but this may involve changing parameters, function names, types, and so on to agree with the change they want to make. Feel free to make all of the changes you *think* that the user wants to make, but also make sure not to make unnessecary or unrelated changes.

## Instructions

1. If you do not want to make any changes, you should respond with the word "no".

2. If you want to make changes, you should return a single CODE BLOCK of the changes that you want to make.
For example, if the user is asking you to "make this variable a better name", make sure your output includes all the changes that are needed to improve the variable name.
- Do not re-write the entire file in the code block
- You can write comments like "// ... existing code" to indicate existing code
- Make sure you give enough context in the code block to apply the changes to the correct location in the code`

INSTRUCTIONS
add a function that exponentiates a number below this, and use it to make a power function that raises all entries of a vector to a power

## ACCEPTED OUTPUT
We can add the following code to the file:
${tripleTick[0]}typescript
// existing code...
const subtractNumbers = (a, b) => a - b
const exponentiateNumbers = (a, b) => Math.pow(a, b)
const divideNumbers = (a, b) => a / b

const raiseAll = (vector: number[], power: number) => {

		vector[i] = exponentiateNumbers(vector[i], power)
	return vector
}

INSTRUCTIONS
memoize results

## ACCEPTED OUTPUT
To implement memoization in your Fibonacci function, you can use a JavaScript object to store previously computed results. This will help avoid redundant calculations and improve performance. Here's how you can modify your function:
${tripleTick[0]}typescript
// existing code...
const fib = (n, memo = {}) => {
	if (n < 1) return 1;
	if (memo[n]) return memo[n]; // Check if result is already computed
	memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo); // Store result in memo
	return memo[n];
}
${tripleTick[1]}
Explanation:
Memoization Object: A memo object is used to store the results of Fibonacci calculations for each n.
Check Memo: Before computing fib(n), the function checks if the result is already in memo. If it is, it returns the stored result.
Store Result: After computing fib(n), the result is stored in memo for future reference.
